We seek to determine if the public transportation number of routes, times of routes, locations of routes, and frequency of routes is sufficient to assit citizens living in the food deserts of Maricopa County to reach accessible, affordable food in an efficient manner.  

An example of why this is important:

"New York (CNN Business)The coronavirus has made it harder for everyone to buy food
and other essential items under stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines and
limited delivery slots for online groceries.
But even before the pandemic, millions of people in the United States were struggling with
access to groceries — and the problem has gotten even worse for them."

"Beyond job loss or a drop in income, other factors during the pandemic have made it
harder for residents already struggling with access to low-priced meats and produce,
public health experts say.
Food prices have increased, stretching low-income residents' budgets. Overall, the price of
groceries grew 2.6% in April, the biggest month-to-month increase since 1974, according
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Egg prices shot up 16.1%, meat prices spiked 3.3% and
fruit and vegetables prices ticked up 1.5%.
"With the economic hit many people have taken over the last few months, it's tougher to
afford fresh, healthy food like fruits and veggies, which are more expensive than
processed items," said Michael Widener, geographer at the University of Toronto.
Additionally, online grocery delivery is out of reach for some customers who use food
stamps. Around 38 million Americans relied on food stamps last year, according to the
non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities." 

"In 2019, for the first time, the USDA gave the green light for food stamp recipients in New York
to use their benefits to buy groceries online and get them delivered to their homes. During the pandemic, the Agriculture Department has raced to allow more states to sign on to the online expansion of food stamps. But 15 states still do not allow customers to redeem benefits online."
